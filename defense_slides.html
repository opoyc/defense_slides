## Thesis contents

**Chapter I - Exploring the dynamics of Bitcoin Price: A Bayesian Structural Time Series Approach.**
&gt; Elicits cryptocurrencies in light of economic mindset. The approach includes a discussion about its "currency" vs "asset" conceptualization. Nonetheless, it is an exploratory study in general terms that aimed to find which are the factors that drive the price.

**Chapter II - Investors’ biases and herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market.**

&gt; Provide a conceptual framework to understand investing decision-making in cryptocurrency markets.

**Chapter III - Attention, meta-information and behavioral convergence in cryptocurrency markets: A SVAR analysis**
&gt; Emphasize three traits that define decision making in crypto markets: attention-grabbing bias, behavioral convergence (herding) and response to uncertainty.

## Chapter I - Exploring the dynamics of Bitcoin Price: A Bayesian Structural Time Series Approach.

---
### Objectives

- Review the economic literature about cryptocurrencies.
- Define a set of potential drivers of Bitcoin price, that lets to: 
  - Generate hypothesis.
- Determine which are relevant social, financial and macroeconomic factors determine Bitcoin's price. That help to shed light about the scope and consequences for the economy. 

### Contribution

- Introduce an organized set of drivers, and how their relevancy is associated with different characteristics of Bitcoin.
- A Spatio-temporal perspective of attraction, the most relevant predictor of BTC price.
  - Bayesian variable selection of the drivers based on a data-driven approach known as Spike and Slab.

### Background

#### **What is Bitcoin?**: 
- _"...it can be defined as a protocol, platform, currency or payment method"_ (Athey et al. 2016)
- _"...a set of technologies that established the framework to interchange money named bitcoins through a decentralized peer-to-peer network named Blockchain_" (Astonopoulos, 2014).
- _“...a commodity money without gold, fiat money without the state, and credit money without debt” _(Bjerg, 2016).

#### **What is an Altcoin?**
- Stands for "alternative coin", refers to other digital/crypto-currencies different from Bitcoin.

#### Disagreements and consensus

- _[...] it lacks intrinsic value, long verification process of the transactions and high volatility._ (Yermack, 2013).

- _Bitcoin is a speculative asset_ (Baek &amp; Elbeck, 2014; Bartos, 2015; Bouoiyour &amp; Selmi, 2016ab; Bouri et al, 2017; Dyhrberg, 2016, among others)

---
### Literature

- Bitcoin volatility is a great limitation to meet the store of value function of money, moreover, it lacks intrinsic value, and the speed of transactions due to long verification process pose more limitations. Yermack (2013)
  - Regarding its use as a currency, it is tightly linked to the credibility and acceptance from users and merchants (Luther 2016).
- Kristoufek (2015) opens the discussion of the duality property of Bitcoin (digital currency or speculative asset) by arguing that **“although the Bitcoin is usually considered a purely speculative asset, we find that standard fundamental factors -usage in trade, money supply, and price level-play a role in Bitcoin price over the long term.”**



---
### Data

**Dependent variable:**

- Bitcoin price in levels

**Independent variables:**
  - Internal factors
    - USD exchange trade volume
    - Median confirmation time for a block to be accepted
    - Hash rate that measures the power of miner’s machines.
    - The number of transactions excluding the 100 most popular addresses.
External factors
  - Attractiveness
    - Google trends: Weekly search queries the index for “bitcoin” from 27 different countries.
       - Varies across countries: Dynamic time warping dissimilarity algorithm
  - Macro-financial
    - S&amp;P500 index: Indicator of the performance of a group of relevant stock market companies
    - Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX)
    - The bearish sentiment from the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey
    - Gold’s price
    - Exchanges rate of the euro with the dollar (EURO-USD), dollar with the yuan (USD-YUAN)

---

### Methodology

- Spike and slab priors for variable selection
- Structural time series (state-space model) consists of two equations: a measurement equation which links the observed variables to unobserved state variables and a transition equation which describes the dynamics of the state variables

&amp;nbsp;

Observation/measurement equation:

$$
y_t=Z_t^T\alpha_t+\varepsilon_t \qquad \varepsilon_t \sim N(0, H_t)
$$

&amp;nbsp;

Transition/state equation:

$$
\alpha_{t+1}=T_t\alpha_t+R_t\eta_t \qquad \eta_t \sim N(0, Q_t)
$$

&amp;nbsp;

- `\(y_t\)`: vector of observations
- `\(\alpha_t\)`: unobserved state vector
- `\(Z_t,\, H_t,\,T_t,\, R_t, Q_t\)`: structural parameters' matrices
- `\(\varepsilon_t,\,\eta_t\)`: serially and mutually independent errors

- Internal drivers found to have no significance to explain Bitcoin.
- Typically used financial-related variables like gold price, S&amp;P500 and bilateral exchange rates are related to Bitcoin price, nonetheless, the had little prediction power to explain BTC dynamics.
  - Bitcoin's relationship is reasonably stronger with exchange rates than any other price driver studied.
- There is a substantial difference both in the sign and behavior of time-variant coefficients over time of both bilateral exchange rates into consideration.

## Conclusions

1. Bitcoin is represented by an amalgam of features and uses, which makes it difficult to frame it into a precedent element in economic studies.
  1. Its high volatility makes it an attractive product for risk-seekers' individuals.
  1. It has been mentioned that Bitcoin's value and impact will depend greatly on the forces that drive the price since it exposes its application.
1. This study contributed to the discussion of Bitcoin price determinants by accounting internal and external factors.
  1. The results show that Bitcoin’s price has a small relationship with gold (negative), Yuan and US Dollar exchange rate (negative), S&amp;P500 (negative). And a significantly higher association with different countries’ search trends.
  1. Search volume or attraction from the public found to be the most relevant price driver. Other variables' effects found to be negligible.
1. The future of any cryptocurrency is directly related to the credibility people assign to it, this, concerning its use as a currency, payment method or asset.

- Is Bitcoin a currency or an asset?
- Is the cryptocurrency market susceptible to a speculative bubble?

## Chapter II - Investors’ biases and herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market.

---
### Objectives

- Characterize the cryptocurrency markets from a behavioral economics perspective.
- Find commonalities with current evidence on investor's biases present in financial-like settings.
- Demonstrate that crypto-market suffers from fragility by testing herding behavior as a source of market instability.

### Contribution

- Literature relating to behavioral economics and cryptocurrencies is barely existent yet.
- There **were** no herding behavior works on this topic (up to the time it was published).

### Background | Searching for the parallelism: Behavioral economics

**Controversy:**

- By the late 1980s, there was a growing sense that some basic facts about financial markets were hard to reconcile with the traditional financial economics theory.
- Shiller (1981) demonstrated that fluctuations in stock market prices are unlikely a result of a rational forecast of firms' future cash flows.
  - Several cases of "anomalies" were found
  - Speculative bubbles
    - Dot-com
    - Black Monday
- The existence of several speculative bubbles episodes stimulated the research on behavioral economics applications to finance.
- An important finding of recent years is that many of the patterns we observe in the stock market are also present in other asset classes.
  - Real state
  - Long-term bonds

### Background | Behavioral economics: The cryptocurrency case

- Any disclosure evoking a "new economy" will always be an allure for people eager for profits.

&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/c2_kindleberger_bubble.png" alt="Anatomy of bubbles" width="60%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Anatomy of bubbles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&gt; Is a combination of two things people know the least: information technology and finance (not mine)

- Behavioral economists advocates insist on the argument that crashes are determined endogenously by investor's actions.
    - Unexpected reactions
    - "Gut feeling"
    - Momentum investor

- In **Chapter I** it has been found that the interest from the public had the highest prediction power.
  - Social learning heuristics are intrinsic to crypto-markets.
  - Crypto-investors' biases could be the reason for excessive volatility.

**Can behavioral economics elucidate on the cryptocurrency puzzle?**

**Can we test for the existence of speculative bubbles in cryptocurrencies?**
]

Problems:

- Most of the tests are designed to identify abnormal deviations from fundamentals
- Fundamental valuation is arguably valid in cryptocurrencies
- Speculative bubbles can only be determined *ex-post*

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

.center[**Nonetheless, we can test if the system suffer from fragility**]

### Background | Herding behavior

**What is herding?**

- A process that stems when someone **choose to ignore her private information and instead jump to the bandwagon by mimicking the actions of individuals who acted previously**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
- Herding or behavioral convergence entails the existence of a coordination mechanism (Devenow and Welch, 1996).
  - Coordination/transmission mechanism can be indirect or direct signals
  - Word-of-mouth, news and social media exposition, in-place observation, etc.
    - **First degree: Observe other's decision-makers**
    - **Second degree: Price movements**

]

---
### Background | Herding behavior in crypto-markets

**Characteristics:**

- Social judgment is intrinsic to the cryptocurrency market since the valuation of any currency is contingent on the extension of the group that founds it valuable.
- Shapiro &amp; Varian (1999, 2004) stated that **old economy** differentiates from the **new economy** in the **substitution of economies of scale by the economics of networks**
- It is profitable to achieve the interest of a critical mass of users/investors that yield a higher market capitalization.
- De Long et al. (1990)  **noise trader**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; **misperceive expected returns** and **generate beliefs and heuristics to buy and sell following a simple feedback rule** -&gt; &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt; **Volatility** &lt;/span&gt;
- Scharfstein and Stein (1990) stated that within individual investment environments, **managers usually disregard private information by adopting a follow-the-crowd strategy**
- **Limits of attention** increase the probability of herding due to the difficulty to accurately process information (Hirshleifer and Hong Teoh, 2003).
- Welch (2000) found that **analysts herd in their stock recommendations**, exposing **significant positive correlation between adjacent analysts**
- Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer and Welch (1992) proved that herding &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;**explain conformity, fads, fashions, booms, and crashes**&lt;/span&gt;

### Background | Herding

**What is the relationship between herding and speculative bubbles?**

- Sheds light on the fragility of the system in face of extreme price movements
- Herding solely could not explain the presence of speculative bubbles, but it provides information about **crypto-market conformity dynamics** that entails **fragility** and **bubble susceptible** behavior

### Data

- The last cut showed that there were 1557 different cryptocurrencies available in the market
- This study dampens the sample to the first 100 leading ones which in aggregated terms account for nearly 96% of total cryptocurrency’s (CC) market capitalization.
- Data was scraped from [www.coinmarketcap.com]("www.coinmarketcap.com") website
- Range of date varies between cryptocurrencies From 2013-04-01 to 2018-04-15
- No distinction over categories

$$
`\begin{align}
R_{c,t}=\frac{CP_{t}-CP_{t-1}}{CP_{t-1}}
\end{align}`
$$

&amp;nbsp;

`\(R_{c,t}\)`: Market returns for the cryptocurrency `\(c\)`  
`\(CP_t\)`: Closing prices for time `\(t\)`

---

### Methodology | CSAD

Cross Sectional Absolute Deviation (CSAD) is calculated as:

$$
`\begin{align}
CSAD_t=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \left | R_{c,t}-\bar{R}_{m,t} \right |}{N}
\end{align}`
$$

- `\(CSAD_t\)`: Cross Sectional Absolute Deviations of Bitcoin' returns for time `\(t\)`  
- `\(\bar{R}_{m,t}\)`: Cross Sectional **Median** Return for crypto-market portfolio `\(m\)` across time `\(t\)`

- Solves the problem of subjective assign of thresholds
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Basic idea: **if market participants tend to follow the consensus and ignore their priors during periods of large price movements, then the linear and increasing relation between dispersion and market return will no longer hold**
- The relation can become non-linearly increasing (adverse herding) or even decreasing (herding)

---
### Methodology | Specification

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

$$
`\begin{matrix}
CSAD_{t,1}=\gamma_{0,1}+\gamma_{1,1} D\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+\gamma_{2,1} (1-D)\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+ \\
\qquad \qquad D\times\gamma_{3,1} R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_{4,1} (1-D)\times R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_{4+k,1}CSAD_{t-k,1}+\varepsilon_{t,1} &amp; S_t=1\\
CSAD_{t,2}=\gamma_{0,1}+\gamma_{1,2} D\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+\gamma_{2,2} (1-D)\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+ \\
\qquad \qquad D\times\gamma_{3,2} R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_{4,2} (1-D)\times R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_{4+k,2}CSAD_{t-k,2}+\varepsilon_{t,2} &amp; S_t=2\\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
CSAD_{t,i}=\gamma_{0,i}+\gamma_{1,i} D\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+\gamma_{2,i} (1-D)\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+ \\
\qquad \qquad D\times\gamma_{3,i} R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_{4,i} (1-D)\times R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_{4+k,i}CSAD_{t-k,i}+\varepsilon_{t,i} &amp; S_t=i\\
\end{matrix}`
$$
with:
`\(\varepsilon_{t,i} \sim N(0,\sigma_{i}^2) \  for \ i=1,...,n\)`

- Parameters `\(\gamma_r \  \ for\ \ r=1,...,4+k\)` and `\(\sigma^2_s\)` will be allowed to change
- The model employed Newey and West (1987) variance estimator to produce consistent standard errors in the presence of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity.
- The number of "regimes" is chosen given Akaike Information Criteria (AIC)
- Subjectivity exists into presenting an equilibrium between descriptive power and interpretability

- The relevance of this result lies in the informational properties of crypto-markets. Agents might rely on current market conditions to define and shape the expected value of any cryptocurrency, prices are the coordination mechanism.
- Crypto-investors behave in aggregate consensus in the existence of extreme market returns. 
- Herding is ubiquitous to crypto-markets, but there is a visible stronger tendency to follow the consensus in comparison to adverse herding.]

- Crypto-investors herd in both directions; nonetheless, the magnitude in which they react to declining conditions is almost three times greater than what could be seen in increasing conditions. 
- Crypto-investors seem to be affected by the likelihood of losing money, henceforth, they shape outweigh “bad news,” conveyed by a seemly declining evolution of the coordination mechanism.  ]

---

### Conclusions

- Behavioral economics provides seemly suitable insights to explain crypto-market price dynamics.
- The single most striking result of the research is that herding is not an unusual phenomenon or anomaly; instead, *herding is a regularity of the crypto-market*.
  - Representing an opposite side to what a rational asset pricing establishes, that is, investors' following their private beliefs, and a random investing decision that is ultimately are corrected in the market,
  - Crypto-investors frequently follow the consensus under market stress situations.
  - Under different market conditions, herding has been evidenced in increasing returns scenarios, while in decreasing periods the evidence was not overwhelming (HODL can be an actual strategy).
- Herding has been intensifying since 2016 and it got stronger during the last months of 2017. 
  - The boost of herding entails market fragility.
- A market as ambiguous as the cryptocurrencies is chaotic by construction, without any guide that determines an objective valuation that anchors informed expectations, it is impossible to coordinate a large sum of bias-prone individuals. **Trust may not be enough.**

## Chapter III - Attention, meta-information and behavioral convergence in cryptocurrency markets: A SVAR analysis

---

### Objectives

- Integrate the insights from the 2 previous chapters.
- Propose a proxy to measure behavioral convergence in the cryptocurrency market.
- Approximate a causal interpretation of the relationship across the relevant elements of a crypto-market system.

### Background

- Human beings have limited computational resources to undertake a decision-making task.
- Anomalies are far more common in crypto markets than in financial environments.
- The searching problem is solved by investing in attention-grabbing stocks.
  - Abnormal trading volume.
  - Extreme one-day returns.
- Bitcoin plays a dual role, first, it is an amalgam of currency and an asset, and secondly as a meta-informational input to convey trust to the entire "crypto-market".
  - Trust is a proxy for loss-aversion.
- The market acts like a feedback loop cues `\(\rightarrow\)` reaction `\(\rightarrow\)` strategy `\(\rightarrow\)` cues

&amp; \gamma_{5} D \times Vol^{R_{m,t}}_t+ \gamma_{6}(1-D) \times Vol^{R_{m,t}}_t+\\
&amp; \gamma_{7}CSAD_{t-1}+\gamma_{8}CSAD_{t-2}+\gamma_{9}CSAD_{t-3}

`\begin{align}
   HIND=\hat{\gamma_{3,t}}|\Omega_{t-1}\\

#### 2. Measuring uncertainty:

`\begin{equation}
\sigma_t^2=\omega + \sum_{i=1}^q (\alpha_i\epsilon^2_{t-i}+\gamma_i I_{t-i}\epsilon^2_{t-i})+\sum^p_{j=1}\beta_j \sigma^2_{t-j}
\end{equation}`

where the `\(I_t\)` indicator variable describe the bias stemming from the less than average returns described as:

`\begin{equation*}
I_{t-i}=\left\{\begin{matrix}
1 &amp; if \ r_{t-i}&lt;\mu \\
0 &amp; if \ r_{t-i}\geq \mu
\end{matrix}\right.

- Bitcoin is more than an asset/currency, it also conveys trust on the whole market, i.e. if Bitcoin is doing good, that market is going well.
- It defines strategy to follow, for instance, momentum trading.
]

.p12[
- One shock from Bitcoin’s returns generates a short-term effect on the level of attention, which remains
for several days, prices indeed react faster than revealed attention.
- A positive shock in BTC returns is associated with a decrease in dispersion, but the effect cancels out quickly.
- A shock of Bitcoin’s returns sends a signal to the participants to follow a momentum strategy and increasing their demand for other cryptocurrencies expecting to capture profits in the short term.
- BTC returns sends a signal to the participants, then they react by following the consensus by demanding more of the any of the cryptocurrencies used to generate the index.

- A shock from the attention-grabbing index does not affect BTC returns. Meaning that this relationship is directional.
- Attention does affect the dispersion of the BTC horizon of 2 days, then it is adjusted quickly and shows a positive long-lasting response.

.p12[
- Attention either manifested from cues-seekers and momentum traders’ agents, serve as drivers to decision-making, either to play a contrarian or herding role, and not the other way around. 
- An impulse in herding under decreasing market states does not affect ATT, however, it does have a significant (but small one) response on Bitcoins’ returns.

- The more the market coordinates their behavior, the less dispersion around the BTC price. The transmission of market-wide uncertainty is passed to price returns.

## Conclusion

- The absence of reliable signals, there is strong evidence of crypto-investors to resort to ignore their private information and follow the consensus.
- Crypto-investors are highly adverse to losses, therefore they engage in trading strategies that emulate what the coordination mechanism conveys, generating a feedback loop.
- In the absence of cues on fundamentals, prices guides crypto-investors, therefore, there is little chance for the market to correct itself by the active participation of individuals if all form beliefs according to the positive feedback valuation only. 
- There is little chance of market correction, this is associated with unstable market conditions, failing to generate rational expectations, and prone to generate bubbles and fads as many other authors have expressed in other sectors.

## Insights' summary

1. In a constantly changing environment that cryptocurrency exposes, it is highly important to introduce a dynamic analysis to understand and differentiate between perennial and long-lasting relationships. In that sense, this thesis emphasized into adopting such perspective.
1. Cryptocurrencies are practically isolated from the economy outside, namely financial and macroeconomic conditions. If so, any impact that might affect here will have little effect on the economy.
1. This thesis sheds light on the price-setting puzzle by attributing price movements to investors herding behavior, that is, a collective decision-making process in which prices “as is” are the coordination mechanism to investment decisions.
1. Human beings and crypto-investors, in particular, have limited resources to process information and weak prior knowledge, as a consequence, they rely on other sources to form beliefs and expectations on crypto-markets.
  1. In the crypto market, this can trigger the formation of speculative bubbles.
1. The current behavioral setting within the cryptocurrency market posits doubts about their use as a currency since volatility is a persistent trait.
  1. High uncertainty makes difficult to determine buying/selling decisions.
1. It has been proved that individuals herd in crypto markets which is an outstanding cast for inefficiency.
  1. When there is no clear definition of the value of an asset, the current set of events could provoke instability.
1. Crypto-market does follow a strong aggregate positive feedback strategy: there is a high likelihood that the next state will be strong herding as well, given that the previous exhibited the same. 
  1. This means that once there is evidence of people to ignore their own priors substantially, herding propagates in the market, which is unlikely to be corrected back to the “normal” state.

## Chapter II

### Searching for the parallelism: Efficient markets

- Current theoretical framework on financial economics assumes markets function **efficiently** &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
--

- An efficient market is characterized by:
  - *Large numbers of rational, profit-maximizers and, actively competing individuals*
  - Current information is almost freely available to all participants
  - Actual prices reflect the effects of salient announcements
  - The actual price is a good estimate of assets' intrinsic value&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
--

- EMH had an unprecedented impact on the economic theory and practice of modern financial economics
    
.footnote[
[1] Contemporaneous modern finance theory is based on the contribution of Eugene Fama, Stephen Ross, Robert Merton, Myron Scholes, William Sharpe, among others.

[2] Fundamental or intrinsic value is the true value of a stock-based business measured by the discounted cash flows of a firm.

### Optimism and overconfidence &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

+ People exhibit exacerbated trust on their own ability, knowledge, and skills
--

+ Self-reliance on personal judgments entails
    - miscalibration  
    - over-precision  
    - optimism  
    - and overreaction to random events
--

- Examples:
    - **90% of Swedish car drivers considered themselves better than the median driver** (Svenson, 1981).
    - People fail to assign probabilities and calibrate unexpected events. 
        - When asked for 1% and 99% tails for inflation and exchange rates, the results found experts had **20% rate of "surprise" instead of the expected 2%** (Alpert &amp; Raiffa, 1982)

---

### Optimism and overconfidence

+ Crypto-investors can easily be overconfident of their capacity to invest in a market characterized by increasing trend and high returns
--

+ Random events in one cryptocurrency are interpreted and extrapolated to other altcoins, **this might be the reason several cryptocurrencies are correlated**

### Information, public interest, and social wisdom

#### Characteristics:
- In the information era, there is an **overload of data** that demands the creation of mechanisms to discern **which information is relevant and which is not.**
--

- Humans have **limited computational capabilities** hence, the formation of **rules of thumb** usually takes place instead of coherent/rational reasoning according to each problem (see Bounded Rationality)
--

- Cryptocurrencies' information is based on fairly diversified sources
    - Whitepapers
    - News, project websites, blogs, and social media.
    - Presumed cryptocurrency’s experts declare higher prices predictions (anchoring prospects)
--
- Reddit: Online forums
    - The largest community on the Internet, with more than 600.000 subscribers
    - Advice to buy and sell
    - Investment in new altcoins
    - Price pattern recognition
---

#### Information, public interest, and social wisdom

- News media have incentives to broadcast hypes to capture the reader’s attention towards different issues, being crypto-markets one of many of them.
--

- Specialized websites offer "social investing", that is, a system that automatically copies trades done by **experienced, professional and successful investors.**
    - Paying a "success fee" as a reward
    - &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Following others’ actions is precisely a clear contradiction to what EMH states about random investors’ decisions.&lt;/span&gt;

#### Information, public interest, and social wisdom

**Hypothesis?**

- An active agent in the crypto marketplace may face:
    - Uncertainty and inability to assess probabilities of events  
    - Problems to decide accurately  
    - Limitations to assess the degree of quality of announcements
--
- **Is it possible to catch up with 2K+ cryptocurrencies and ~40 new ones per month?**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
    - In my opinion: **hardly**. &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Especially in the task of distinguishing between fake and true potential projects.&lt;/span&gt;
--

&gt; Once people receive information, they have to discern if it is accurate or not, **but prices often react faster**, then, it is strategically convenient to **follow what others do**, but because it is unobserved, there are incentives to rely only on **price dynamics**.

### Model: Herding behavior

An empirical test based on absolute dispersion:

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


$$
`\begin{split}
CSAD_t=\gamma_0+\gamma_1\left|R_{m,t}\right|+ \gamma_2 R_{m,t}^2 + \gamma_{2+k}CSAD_{t-k}+\varepsilon_t
\end{split}`
$$

&amp;nbsp;

with:  
`\(\varepsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)`  

+ `\(\gamma_1\)` captures the linear relationship between dispersion and market returns  
+ `\(\gamma_2\)` captures herding with `\(\gamma_2&lt;0\)` and adverse herding for `\(\gamma_2&gt;0\)`  
+ `\(k\)`: AR(k) to dismiss lagged effects

+ The baseline in this model will be a rational model of asset returns, that is, a scenario in which crypto-investors do not follow the consensus.

### Model: Herding behavior under asymmetric market states

An empirical test based on absolute dispersion:

&amp;nbsp;


$$
`\begin{split}
CSAD_t=\gamma_0+\gamma_1 D\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+\gamma_2 (1-D)\times \left|R_{m,t}\right|+D\times\gamma_3 R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_4 (1-D)\times R_{m,t}^2+\gamma_{4+k}CSAD_{t-k}+\varepsilon_t
\end{split}`
$$

&amp;nbsp;

with:  
`\(\varepsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)`  

+ `\(D=1\)`: if `\(R_{m,t}&lt;0\)`  
+ `\(D=0\)`: if `\(R_{m,t}&gt;=0\)`  
+ `\(k\)`: AR(k) to dismiss lagged effects  

---
### Model: Markov Regime-Switching model for herding behavior

A two-state MC can be described as:

`\(P(S_t=j|S_{t-1}=i, S_{t-2}=b, ..., \Omega_{t-l})=P(S_t=j|S_{t-1}=i)=P_{ij}\)`

where:
`\(p_{ij}\)` transition probability of being at `\(j\)` will only depend on the previous state `\(i\)`, `\(S_t\)` is not observed, but it can be inferred from observed data. And, `\(\Omega\)` represent all the parameters necessary to describe the Data Generating Process (DGP)

- MS captures shifts in behavior which are not observable for instance the appearance of interventions or forcing variables.
--

- High-frequency data exhibits structural changes in their behavior associated with observed and unobserved events.
--

- It is expected that herding display dynamics that are regime dependent
    - Adverse herding vs herding
    - Intensity of herding
--
- Herding behavior states are (likely):
    - Unobserved
    - Probabilistic
