# Background
## Bitcoin and the distributed ledger Blockchain

What is Bitcoin?

+ _"...it can be defined as a protocol, platform, currency or payment method"_ (Athey et al. 2016)

+ _... a set of technologies that established the framework to interchange money named bitcoins through a decentralized peer-to-peer network named Blockchain_ (Astonopoulos, 2014).

+ _“...a commodity money without gold, fiat money without state, and credit money without debt” _(Bjerg, 2016).

+ **"Bitcoin is evil"** (Krugman, 2013)

Problems?

+ _it lacks intrinsic value, long verification process of the transactions and high volatility._ (Yermack, 2013).

+ _Bitcoin is a speculative asset_ (Baek & Elbeck, 2014; Bartos, 2015; Bouoiyour & Selmi, 2016ab; Bouri et al, 2017; Dyhrberg, 2016, among others)

+ Social activity in cryptocurrencies communities and constructed a sentiment analysis index to explain Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple cryptocurrencies' prices _(Ciaian, Rajcaniova & D. Kancs 2016; Dwyer 2015; Kim et al. 2016)._

+ Examined the role of Bitcoin as a potential hedge or safe-haven asset by comparing with precious metals and financial indexes. _(Kristoufek, 2015; Bouoiyour & Selmi, 2016a; and Bouri, Gupta, Tiwari, & Roubaud, 2017)._

+ Tested Bitcoin's tendency to generate speculative bubbles. _(Cheah & Fry, 2015 and Baek & Elbeck, 2014)._

# Methodology

## Structural time series


\begin{block}{Space state model}
Consists of two equations, a measurement equation which links the observed variables to unobserved state variables and a transition equation which describes the dynamics of the state variables
\end{block}

Observation/measurement equation:\label{sts_method}

$$
y_t=Z_t^T\alpha_t+\varepsilon_t \qquad \varepsilon_t \sim N(0, H_t)
$$

Transition/state equation:
$$
\alpha_{t+1}=T_t\alpha_t+R_t\eta_t \qquad \eta_t \sim N(0, Q_t)
$$


- $y_t$: vector of observations (observation vector)
- $\alpha_t$: unobserved vector (state vector)
- $Z_t,\, H_t,\,T_t,\, R_t, Q_t$: structural parameters' matrices
- $\varepsilon_t,\,\eta_t$: serially and mutually independent errors

## Bayesian Spike and Slab variable selection

\begin{block}{}\label{spikeandslab}
The $\beta_j$ space is composed by mutually independent two-point mixture distribution made up of a uniform flat distribution (the slab) and a degenerate distribution at zero (the spike). \hyperlink{spikeslab}{\beamergotobutton{Spike \& Slab representation}}
\end{block}

$$
\begin{array}{c}
p(\beta_j|\gamma_j) \sim (1-\gamma_j)\:N(0, \tau_j^2)+\gamma_j\:N(0, c_j \tau_j^2)\qquad
\footnote{George and McCulloch (1993, 1997)} \\
p(\gamma_j)\sim Bernoulli(w_j)
\end{array}
$$

+ The idea behind S\&L is to zero out $\beta_j$ coefficients that are truly 0 by making their posterior mean values small.
    + Small hypervariances $\tau_j^2$ sets $\gamma_j=0$ and asymptotically set the $\beta_j$ as 0
    + Large values of $\tau_j^2$ or $c_j$ result into $\gamma_j=1$ and by extention generating a non-zero estimate of $\beta_j$.

+ **The choice of priors is often tricky, although empirical Bayes approaches can be used to deal with this issue** _(Chipman, George and Mc-Culloch, 2001)_.

## Model specification

Observation/measurement equation:

$$
\begin{array}{lc}
y^*_t=\mu_t+\sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_{j,t}x^*_{j,t}+\varepsilon_{y^*, t} & \varepsilon_{y^*, t} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon_{y^*}}^2)
 \end{array}
$$

Transition/state equation:

$$
\begin{array}{lc}
\mu_{t+1}=\mu_{t}+v_{t}+\varepsilon_{\mu, t} & \varepsilon_{\mu, t} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon_{\mu}}^2) \\
v_{t+1}=v_{t}+\varepsilon_{v, t} & \varepsilon_{v, t} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon_{v}}^2) \\
\beta_{j, t+1}=\beta_{j, t}+\varepsilon_{\beta_j, t} & \varepsilon_{\beta_j, t} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon_{\beta}}^2)
 \end{array}
$$


$$
\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sim \Gamma(\frac{s_1}{2}, \frac{s_2}{2})
$$

+ $y^*_t$ a vector of standardized observations
+ $x^*_t$ a matrix of standardized variables
+ $\mu_t$ is the local level component
+ $v_t$ represents the angle of the trend line that also varies over time.
+ $\beta_{jt}$ represents the coefficients that vary (or not) over time
+ $\varepsilon_{c,t}$ represents the innovations for each component

# Conclusions
## Conclusions

1. Bitcoin represents an amalgam of attributes that demands a deeper meditation to understand its role in the contemporary economic scene
1. None of the internal factors have a relevant impact on the price
1. Yuan depreciation has been found to be associated with an increase on Bitcoin's price
1. In terms of magnitude, macro-financial have higher effects than attractiveness suggesting that it does act as a speculative asset rather than a currency as many authors have stated

# Appendix

## Local linear trend model (LLT)

In linear form the LLT model is given by:\label{example_llt}

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
y_t=\mu_t+\varepsilon_{y,t} & \varepsilon_{y,t} \sim N\left(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon_{y,t}}^2\right) \\
\mu_{t+1}=\mu_t+v_t+\varepsilon_{\mu,t} & \varepsilon_{\mu, t} \sim N\left(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon_{\mu,t}}^2\right) \\
v_{t+1}=v_t+\varepsilon_{v,t} & \varepsilon_{v, t} \sim N\left(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon_{v,t}}^2\right)
\end{array}
$$


It can be translated to space state form as:

\


Observation/measurement equation:

$$
y_t=\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}}_{Z_t} \: \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \mu_t \\ v_t \end{pmatrix}}_{\alpha_t} + \varepsilon_t
$$
Transition/state equation:
$$
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \mu_{t+1} \\ v_{t+1} \end{pmatrix}}_{\alpha_{t+1}} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}}_{T_t} \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \mu_{t} \\ v_{t} \end{pmatrix}}_{\alpha_t} + \underbrace{I_2}_{R_t}
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon_{\mu,t} \\ \varepsilon_{v,t} \end{pmatrix}}_{\eta_t}
$$

## MCMC and Kalman filter\label{mcmc_kf}

\begin{block}{Kalman filter}
The Kalman filter provides a recursive way to compute the estimator of the unobserved component based on the observed variables.
\end{block}

### Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC)\label{mcmc}

Is a general method based on drawing values of $\alpha$ from approximate distributions and then correcting those draws to better approximate the target posterior distribution.

+ Gibbs sampling is used to identify posterior probabilities.
